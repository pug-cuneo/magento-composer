# Install Magento 1 via Composer
While Magento doesn't provide a composer installation for Magento1, here is an easy way to do it.

Clone the repo and install Magento by running:

    $ cd <your-project-folder>
    $ git clone git@github.com:pug-cuneo/magento-composer.git
    $ composer install

Enjoy!
